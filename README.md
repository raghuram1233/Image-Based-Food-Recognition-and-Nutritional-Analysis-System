```

### Installation

Install all dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install individually:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy scipy imutils matplotlib jupyter ipykernel
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Object Dimension Measurement

1. **Configure the script:**

   ```python
   image_path = 'imgs/test1.png'    # Path to your image
   ref_obj_width = 25               # Width of reference object in mm
   ```

2. **Run the measurement:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **How it works:**
   - The script automatically detects objects in the image
   - Uses the first detected object as a reference for scale calibration
   - Calculates and displays dimensions for all other objects
   - Shows measurements overlaid on the image

### Fruit Classification Model Training

1. **Open the training notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Train.ipynb
   ```

2. **Follow the notebook to:**
   - Load and explore the fruit dataset
   - Set up data generators with augmentation
   - Build and compile the CNN model

2. **Run the cells to:**
   - Load the pre-trained model (`Fruits_model.h5`)
   - Test on sample images
   - Get classification results with confidence scores
